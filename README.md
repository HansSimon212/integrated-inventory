<h3>Inventory system: Old vs. New</h3>
<hr>

<h4>Flaws of the old system:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>Highly inefficient:</b> 
        <ul>
            <li>Paper-based communication of inventory transactions</li>
            <li>Google Sheets used as main database</li>
            <li>Relocation of items required manual entry of new location (employees had to walk to the office space in the warehouse and enter new location by hand)</li>
        </ul> 
    </li>
    <li>Error-prone:
        <ul>
            <li>Items missing from filled purchase orders</li>
            <li>Incorrect items sent to customers</li>
            <li>Inconsistent/inaccurate quantities of goods in database.</li>
        </ul> 
    </li>
</ul>
